## Proposal:

Immigration is a hot topic in the political climate today. We are interested in exploring how immigration affects our
economy by observing the real world data. We have information about both productivity in the economy (for various levels)
and numbers from the Dept of Homeland Security about immigration into the United States. Part of this process will be
scraping the data from the Dept of Homeland Security website, as it does not appear to be in a downloadable format.
